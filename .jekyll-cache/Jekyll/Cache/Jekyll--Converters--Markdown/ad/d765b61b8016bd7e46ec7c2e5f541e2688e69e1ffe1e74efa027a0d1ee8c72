I"¾<p>Hi, My name is Hyunsik Lee. I graduated from Hongik Universityâ€™s Software Convergence Department, and I am currently working as a Java developer in a small business. Iâ€™m mainly trying to cover the Spring Framework, and Iâ€™m also interested in algorithms and data analysis. As a developer, this is the first step to start so stay tuned.</p>
