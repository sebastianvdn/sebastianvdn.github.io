Most of us don't like to read.

  

During my complete time in high school I did not finish reading even one book completely. I **hated** reading.

  

Now I **LOVE** it.

  

You wanna know how I got myself so far to love reading?

  

Continue reading, I'll give you the secrets.

  

## How to love reading

There are two methods I applied to really start enjoy reading, the first being:

### Affirmations
This might sound crazy to some of you but it really works.

  

You, know we only hate reading because we *believe* that we hate to read. What if you would change that belief first?

  

That's what I did.

  

I have a list of affirmations that I go over every morning, to change the belief I have about myself/what I like.

  

These look like this:

* I love and enjoy to read

* I love to learn

* Books are fun

* ...

  

This is only one example for how you can change your belief around your willingness to read books right, but you can do this for everything.

  

Confidence.

  

Grattitude.

  

Kindness.

Anyway, it was about books. This brings me to the next thing I implemented:

### Read what you love, until you love to read

This one might sound logic and sh** but you would be amazed by how many people want to start reading but don't pick the right book.

When I started with my journey on growing as a human being, I got the book [*think and grow rich*](https://amzn.to/3s1IVYV) *by Napoleon Hill*. (Thanks sis)

Great man, but his book was way too **complicated** to read as my first book. I was not ready to receive the information shipped with the book either.

As a result, I left it alone and didn't do anything with the valuable information shipped with the book until 6 months later.

So, the whole point only ready what you love to.

Do not read books that you're not excited about.

Read about football if that is what you like.

Stocks.

Business

The body.

You get it, only read books that you are **excited** about.
