I haven't achieved anything significant, nothing that has impacted thousands of lives profoundly.

This is my purpose, **serve** the people and help them in becoming more effective human beings. 
In what I do this does not really matter, but the time has come for me to really start taking **massive action.**

Compared to 95% of 20 y/o guys I have done some impressive shit, I know that. But, I feel this need to do more. 
Accomplish more.
Impact more.
Get more.
So that's what I'm going to do this year, 2021.
I'll put down some huge shit, impress myself. At age 21 I will read this article and be thinking like *"f*ck dude, you empty the bucket"*.
