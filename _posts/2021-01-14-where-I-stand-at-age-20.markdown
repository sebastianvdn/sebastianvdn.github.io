I haven't achieved anything significant, nothing that has impacted thousands of lives profoundly.

This is my purpose, **serve** the people and help them in becoming more effective human beings. 
In what I do this does not really matter, but the time has come for me to really start taking **massive action.**

Compared to 95% of 20 y/o guys I have done some impressive shit, I know that. But, I feel this need to do more. 

Accomplish more.

Impact more.

Get more.

So, that's what I'm going to do this year, 2021.
I'll put down some huge shit, impress myself. At age 21 I will read this article and be thinking like *"f*ck dude, you empty the bucket"*.

### What I am going to achieve by the age of 21 (1 year)

 1. Create my NonJob with [Bgan](https://bgan.be).
 2. Make my first **50,000** euros with my business.
 3. Get **10.000** followers on Bgan's [instagram](https://instagram.com/bgan.be) page.
 4. Have travelled to **two** new countries.
 5. Proper understanding of the stock market.
 6. Made a habit of investing.
 7. Saving **1,000** euros monthly.
 8.  Created a second instagram page, my personal brand - reformed dealer
 9. Focus - daily reading of my goals.
 10. Discipline, Action and Habits.

Let's not make this list too long. These are the things I came up with now, these are important to me.

I will stake even existence for the accomplishments of these goals.

Do this to, write down what you want to accomplish this year.

Sebastian
